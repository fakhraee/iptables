## Howto
1. Make a backup of current rules using iptables-save.
2. Use "rules.v4.fakhraee" to add/remove/modify what you want. Remeber to read comments and use them as much as you should.
3. iptables-restore the rules.v4.fakhraee.
4. Run "fwsnort" and check "/etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.save" for your rules to be there.
5. Run "/etc/fwsnort/fwsnort.sh".

## TODO
1. Someday there may be a script to do above works.
